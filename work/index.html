            <p>Designed and built an e-commerce product for a software consultancy.</p>

            <summary>Description</summary>
            <div><p>I built the V1 of an e-commerce product for Firesqueak with one other engineer.</p>

<p>Inspired by shops that had sold out of remote work equipment at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,
    we decided to build a product that would give stores the ability to provide in-stock notifications.
We started with support for Shopify but designed the app with other e-commerce platforms in-mind.</p>

<p>I researched, designed, and developed the app. The core features were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for SMS in-stock notifications.</li>
  <li>An optional JavaScript snippet to add an in-stock notification UI to a <abbr title="Product Detail Page">PDP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>A REST API backend that the in-stock notification UI integrated with.</li>
  <li>A <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> dashboard for the merchant admin experience, which included:
    <ul>
      <li>Templating to customize the notification messaging.</li>
      <li>Message previewing to verify template customizations.</li>
      <li>Reporting to highlight the most in-demand products.</li>
      <li>Charting to display the number of messages sent per day.</li>
      <li><abbr title="JSON Web Token">JWT</abbr> authentication to embed the UI within Shopify’s admin dashboard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><abbr title="Open Authorization">OAuth</abbr> authorization to support Shopify’s app installation flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also handled the operational work by setting up hosting, provisioning, <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>/<abbr title="Continuous Deployment">CD</abbr>, and monitoring.
The product was a V1, but the technical foundation was mature.</p>

            <p>Built, iterated, and maintained the frontend of an e-commerce site for a footwear brand.</p>

          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Description</summary>
            <div><p>I built a new Shopify site for a footwear brand that specializes in work-wear and clothing for outdoor activities.</p>

<p>The client had an existing e-commerce site but, due to the limitations of their platform,
    they had issues with velocity and content management.
I worked with one other Firesqueak engineer to build the Shopify theme frontend and to support the client’s Shopify/SAP integration on the backend.</p>

<p>This project was a test of my frontend development skills, but my teammate and I divided work based on front-of-the-frontend vs back-of-the-frontend lines.
I focused on the back-of-the-frontend by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configuring the build toolchain to enable the use of modern web development features while still supporting <abbr title="Internet Explorer 11">IE11</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Selecting a minimal set of dependencies to support complex interactions without sacrificing performance.</li>
  <li>Implementing the site features that required non-trivial algorithms and data manipulation such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-select filtering on the <abbr title="Product Listing Page">PLP</abbr>.</li>
      <li>Dynamically displaying inventory status depending on selected options on the PDP.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Creating command-line tools to automate tasks.</li>
  <li>Setting up CI/CD pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also contributed to the front-of-the-frontend by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating the component library and style guide from the designs.</li>
  <li>Implementing responsive layouts for the PDP and <abbr title="Product Listing Page">PLP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that all interactive components were accessible and SEO-friendly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project was intense but we delivered to spec, on-time, and with no production issues.
The project was a success and we exceeded the client’s expectations with the site’s extensibility and robustness.</p>

            <div><p>I built an <abbr title="Extract, Transform, Load">ETL</abbr> pipeline for the finance team of a popular, eco-friendly footwear brand.</p>

<p>The client operated several geographically distinct Shopify sites but needed to collect all transaction and payment data into SAP as a single source of truth for accounting.
They had a single in-house engineer and a business stakeholder that I partnered with, but otherwise I worked independently yet transparently.</p>

<p>In the first week I was able to create a technical spec from loose business requirements and by the following week I had a functioning V1.
I delivered well ahead-of-schedule with zero production issues.
The client saved hundreds of thousands of dollars that they would have otherwise needed to pay to SAP consultants.</p>

          <p>Contributed to a large e-commerce codebase for a meal-kit delivery company.</p>

        <details data-hidden-for="print">
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <div><p>Blue Apron is a meal-kit delivery company.
The engineering organization had fewer than 100 employees when I joined as a Backend Engineer on the <em>Consumer</em> team.
I joined the <em>Delight</em> squad but the team was later rolled into the <em>Engagement</em> squad.
Delight’s priorities were a subset of Engagement’s; the former focused on customer retention while the latter prioritized retention alongside monetization.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges at Blue Apron was in maintaining the written-from-scratch e-commerce engine.
The custom-built nature of the engine allowed the storefront to be deeply integrated with fulfillment on the backend,
    but at the expense of missing standard features and coupling to vast amounts of tech debt.
With this in mind, I took ownership over <em>Address Management</em> since it had been historically overlooked and de-prioritized.
I worked on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leading the implementation of <em>Temporary Address Change</em> for deliveries.</li>
  <li>Fixing design issues and bugs that had been the cause of frequent mis-deliveries.</li>
  <li>Coordinating with the WMS team on the backend to setup address verification before shipping label generation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Temporary Address Change was a conceptually simple feature, it allowed customers to change the delivery address of a single order without having to change their subscription.
I implemented the backend of the feature and I was also the tech lead for the Web, iOS, and Android frontend implementations.</p>

<p>Aside from Address Management, I acted as a technical leader by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring complicated parts of the codebase that were not well-understood.</li>
  <li>Documenting older parts of the codebase that were not well-known.</li>
  <li>Offering guidance to peers in architecture/design reviews, regardless of team.</li>
  <li>Reviewing code to unblock peers, regardless of team.</li>
  <li>Mentoring junior engineers.</li>
</ul>

<p>My experience at Blue Apron was chaotic since I joined in-between rounds of layoffs.
I shifted between several projects that started and stopped as the company’s priorities changed,
    so I did not have the opportunity to complete every project that I worked on.</p>

          <p>Led DevSecOps and fulfillment optimizations for a direct mail API startup.</p>

        <details data-hidden-for="print">
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <div><p>Lob is a startup that had less than 20 employees when I joined; I was one of 4 engineers on the team.
The company offers a SAAS product in the form of RESTful APIs for sending physical mail and verifying addresses.
The Print &amp; Mail API handled tens of thousands of requests per day.</p>

<p>The engineering team was small and without defined roles so we self-assigned responsibilities based on interest and capability.
I had more experience with cloud infrastructure, so I took DevSecOps responsibilities.</p>

<p>One of the first projects I worked on was to setup auto-scaling for the Print &amp; Mail API infrastructure.
This turned out to be a larger than expected task given that all the infrastructure was manually managed through the AWS web interface.
My approach was to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce Terraform to get a handle on critical infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Containerize the application using Docker to automate provisioning.</li>
  <li>Setup a parallel set of infrastructure using AWS ECS for scheduling containers.</li>
  <li>Cut-over from the old infrastructure to the new infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The migration completed without any issues and we were able to leverage AWS to manage auto-scaling with minimal glue code.
There were other benefits and improvements from this approach, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Codified and hardened infrastructure with a paper-trail for auditing changes.</li>
  <li>Explicit, documented, and packaged provisioning to mitigate risks from dependencies.</li>
  <li>Automated deployments with immediate rollbacks to limit downtime when resolving regressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from leading DevSecOps, I also became the lead for the <em>Partner Operations</em> team.
The Partner Operations team was responsible for optimally routing requests on the backend to the Partners that fulfilled them.
Geographic proximity, capability, and available capacity were some of the factors considered when routing to a Partner.</p>

<p>My role on the Partner Operations team was to increase throughput and improve service reliability.
This involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reducing bottlenecks and single-points-of-failure through partitioning and scaling.</li>
  <li>Handling and resolving failures as part of an on-call schedule.</li>
  <li>Researching, designing, and prototyping a V2 of the backend architecture.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a difficult role since the on-call burden was high.
I was not able to deliver a V2 of the backend, but I exhausted most optimization opportunities of the existing code and infrastructure.</p>

        <details data-hidden-for="print">
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <div><p>@WalmartLabs was the largest organization that I have worked for.
I joined the <em>SEO</em> team as a frontend engineer, but what I actually did was full-stack web development.
Most of my teammates were data engineers, so I learned that <em>frontend</em> was a relative term.</p>

<p>The SEO team had several responsibilities, but most of the work centered around support for the <em>Topic Page</em> platform.
Topic Pages were a large set of product listing pages on walmart.com that were automatically generated based on data about frequently searched keywords.</p>

<p>Topic Pages were too narrow and too great in number to fit into the site’s category-based navigation, but they ranked highly in organic search engine results.
They drove hundreds of thousands of visits in traffic and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue to walmart.com every day.</p>

<p>The Topic Page platform consisted of dozens of services, so every member of the team acted as a custodian of at least one or two services.
One of the services I maintained was an internal application known as <em>Mason</em>, a CMS-like tool for Topic Pages.</p>

<p>Mason was on life support when I first started working on it.
The app was buggy, hard to use, and almost no one understood its purpose or its capabilities.
The SEO team mainly used it as a manual override for when there were issues with the generation of certain Topic Pages.</p>

<p>When the SEO team started to port the Topic Page platform to support samsclub.com it became clear that Mason needed significant rework.
As part of the porting effort, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleared the backlog of reported and unreported bugs.</li>
  <li>Simplified the UI/UX to improve usability.</li>
  <li>Handled support requests from users.</li>
  <li>Created user documentation to reduce the rate of support requests.</li>
  <li>Demoed features to the Site Merchandising team to grow usage.</li>
  <li>Migrated from <em>pet</em> servers to automated, internal cloud hosting.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to make Mason multi-tenant to support Sam’s Club while simultaneously increasing usage among Walmart’s Site Merchandising team.
Mason became a go-to tool for setting up campaigns in partnership with large brands; a new use case for Mason and a new revenue source that became possible as a direct result of my efforts.</p>

<p>Aside from Mason, I was also contributor to the customer-facing frontend of Topic Pages on walmart.com and the backing web services.</p>

          <p>Extended an email marketing e-commerce product for a startup.</p>

        <details data-hidden-for="print">
          <summary>Description</summary>
          <div><p>Sendicate was a startup with a team consisting of just the two co-founders and myself.
The company’s main product was a competitor to Mailchimp, but I joined to work on a new product called <em>Sellout</em>.
Sellout was an automated email marketing app for Shopify and Bigcommerce stores.</p>

<p>The headline feature I delivered was <em>Manual Emails</em>.
I built a WYSIWYG editor that could design emails using a set of predefined content blocks; essentially a CMS for email campaigns.</p>

<p>The CTO built the backend but gave me free reign to build the frontend since I had more recent experience with JavaScript.
With this project, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selected a minimal, conceptually simple set of dependencies.</li>
  <li>Made my first contribution to the <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> community via an improvement to one of the Bootstrap framework’s interactive components.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first large JavaScript project, but I was able to ship and the feature launch was a success.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I paired with the CTO to add subscription billing and I learned about the backend.
The CTO later left for another company, but I continued to work on Sellout for a period of time.
During that time, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added caching to the product recommendations engine to improve response times.</li>
  <li>Migrated the infrastructure to another platform to cut costs.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs and fielded technical customer support.</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t ship any new features,
    but I learned a great deal about operating a SAAS product while I was on my own.</p>
