    <h1>Personal README: Teammate Edition</h1>

    <article>
      
  <p>In the <a href="/blog/new-manager-readme/">previous post</a> I wrote about how I share a personal <code>README</code> with any new manager that I report to.
What I‚Äôll be discussing here is a similar idea but targeted towards new teammates.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I have not sent personal <code>README</code>s to teammates in the past since most will understand how I work after enough time seeing it in practice.
That said, I can‚Äôt think of a good reason not to front-load information like this.</p>

<p>I think that a code style guide is semi-analogous to a personal <code>README</code>.
Even when a team doesn‚Äôt have an explicit style guide, each developer will still have their own style preferences.
If a team of developers are working on the same codebase, then, they will organically form a style ‚Äúequilibrium‚Äù for the codebase (assuming that the team stays the same over time).</p>

<p>A gradual process is fine for most teams, but it has potential for optimization.
If the developers can agree, upfront, to a style guide then it can save time in code review.
Explicit consensus for conventions is also the basis for automation.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that the benefits of personal <code>README</code>s are comparable to the benefits of code style guides.
Obviously it would be difficult to automate the details that are more abstract, but having these discussions ahead-of-time can save time through fewer meetings or discussions.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my first draft‚Ä¶</p>

<hr />

<p>Hello! I‚Äôm excited to be part of <code>${COMPANY}</code> and I‚Äôm delighted to be working with you on the <code>${TEAM}</code> team.
Thanks for bringing me on board!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm looking forward to rummaging through documents, spelunking into the depths of version control history, and the sideways looks that are to come.
Before I get carried away with that, though, I wanted to share a bit about myself that you might find helpful when working with me.</p>

<p>Half of this information is about specific things you‚Äôll see me do on a routine basis.
I won‚Äôt describe everything that I do, just the subset that might seem uncommon or unusual.</p>

<p>The other half is more philosophical and opinionated.
I‚Äôve focused on strongly-held opinions, but none of it‚Äôs prescriptive.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-reviewer-">As a Reviewer üîé</h2>

<p>On a day-to-day basis, I expect to spend most of my time reviewing code.
I have a lot of experience in this capacity and I think that code review is a great place for knowledge transfer, among other things.</p>

<p>When I review code, I:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Scale thoroughness according to impact:</dt>
  <dd>I spend more time reviewing changes that could introduce breakages.</dd>
  <dd>I spend less time reviewing changes that are trivial.</dd>
  <dt>Include justifications for my suggestions:</dt>
  <dd>I want the author to understand and agree with requested changes.</dd>
  <dt>Use a <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">comment convention</a>:</dt>
  <dd>I include metadata to help the author determine the priority of each of my comments.</dd>
  <dt>Prefer small and focused changes:</dt>
  <dd>It‚Äôs easier to detect issues when there is less code to review.</dd>
  <dd>It‚Äôs easier to follow along when the changes have fewer goals.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="as-a-contributor-">As a Contributor üèó</h2>

<p>I won‚Äôt get into low-level details about how I write code since there are better resources available on the subject.
Furthermore, writing code is just one part of the challenge of working on a shared codebase.</p>

<p>A bigger challenge, I think, is how to effectively <em>package</em> code changes.
<em>Packaging</em> refers to the work that goes into making code changes reviewable and understandable.</p>

<p>When I contribute code, I:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Arrange commits to show an incremental, linear series of events:</dt>
  <dd>Each commit is a singular, focused change so that the reviewer can assess scope and impact with less effort.</dd>
  <dd>Each commit is a checkpoint along the way to the reviewer‚Äôs complete understanding of the changes.</dd>
  <dt>Differentiate between behavioral and non-behavioral changes:</dt>
  <dd>It‚Äôs easier to verify that isolated, non-behavioral changes <strong>do not change</strong> behavior.</dd>
  <dd>It‚Äôs easier to verify that isolated, behavioral changes <strong>specifically change</strong> behavior in expected ways.</dd>
  <dd>It‚Äôs harder to verify that non-behavioral and behavioral, together, are correct.</dd>
  <dt>Annotate changes using code review comments:</dt>
  <dd>I write comments on my own pull/merge requests to direct the reviewer‚Äôs attention and to provide context for specific changes.</dd>
  <dt>Specify manual test cases in the absence of automated tests:</dt>
  <dd>I test every line of code that I write.</dd>
  <dd>I write down every test that I run, but I don‚Äôt write every test using code.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="as-a-thinker-">As a Thinker ü§î</h2>

<p>If I‚Äôm not reading or writing code then it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm thinking about how to create some software.
This is sometimes referred to as software design or architecture.</p>

<p>As software people, I think that we underestimate how much subjective factors such as ideals and fashion influence our work.
This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but it‚Äôs at least something to be conscious of.
To that end, I‚Äôll share the opinions that influence how I build things.</p>

<p>As someone that thinks about software, I:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Believe that knowledge maintenance is a significant challenge for teams:</dt>
  <dd>Even small amounts of code in critical paths that no one understands can drag down the productivity of an entire team.</dd>
  <dd>Documentation helps to fill in gaps, but understandable and self-evident software designs are best.</dd>
  <dt>Place more value on prototypes than design documents:</dt>
  <dd>Working software allows stakeholders to interact with their ideas and lets developers prove an initial design. Evidence is better than theory.</dd>
  <dt>Prefer <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>:</dt>
  <dd>Boring tools have fewer unexpected issues.</dd>
  <dd>Fewer unexpected issues means more time spent on your own codebase and less time reporting bugs to someone else‚Äôs.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="end">(END)</h2>

<p>My way of doing software is not exclusive, you don‚Äôt have to agree with me on everything (or anything!).
My hope is that this will inspire you to reflect on the things <em>you do</em> and the things <em>you think about</em> in the context of software.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I‚Äôm looking forward to doing great work with you.</p>

<p>‚Äì <em>Charlie</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I haven‚Äôt formally shared this with any team yet, but when I do then I‚Äôll return to this post to add an update with my findings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please let me know what you think and if you have tried something like this before.</p>
