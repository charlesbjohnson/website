    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <article>
      
  <p>Let me share a story about this website.</p>

<h2 id="decay-️">Decay 🧟‍♂️</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/charlesbjohnson/cbjohnson.info/commit/66f645b22b06e9e6eedbe52bcf01951205fbc4a9">Eight years ago</a> I built a personal website with a blog.
I had just learned Ruby and had a limited understanding of web development.
The site looked bad and my writing was even worse.
I didn’t keep up with it.</p>

<p>Some years later I stopped writing Ruby and picked up JavaScript instead.
I rebuilt my website using a Node toolchain of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a>, <a href="https://posthtml.org/#/">PostHTML</a>, and <a href="https://acss.io/">Atomizer</a>.
I made the site look nicer but had to scale it down to a single page.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present day and I’m, once again, revisiting my website.
As an aside, it’s fun to see that I was ahead of the curve with utility-first CSS adoption (aka “Atomic” CSS).
TailwindCSS JIT is great, but <a href="https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-atomizer">I already did it in 2018</a> 😉</p>

<p>Beyond the nostalgia, though, I realized that I couldn’t pick up the site from where I left off.
Even with just a single page, the site was more complicated than the statically generated version that preceded it.</p>

<p>Why was this the case? Well…</p>

<ul>
  <li>I couldn’t install dependencies. <code>npm install</code> logged dozens of deprecation warnings before ultimately failing.</li>
  <li>My Webpack configuration splayed out over seven files but was also stitched back together through a complicated set of <code>webpack-merge</code> rules.</li>
  <li>I used 16 different PostCSS plugins. I don’t remember what most of them were for.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Node version of the site was smaller in scope but denser in implementation.
I hadn’t written much code, but decay had set in as a result of enormous dependency on code downloaded off the internet.</p>

<h2 id="starting-over-">Starting Over 🔁</h2>

<p>Once again, I’ve rebuilt my site.
In some ways I’ve returned to the mindset I had when I built my site the first time.</p>

<p>My first site was necessarily simple because I didn’t know how to make it look pretty or be fancy.
I’m still not great at either of those things, but the difference now is that I embrace <a href="https://beza1e1.tuxen.de/spartan_web.html">Spartan Web</a> design.
<a href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">Perfect MF’ing Website</a> is actually usable compared to 90% of <a href="https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/">the web today</a>.
My new site doesn’t try to look pretty or be fancy, it just looks decent and loads fast.</p>

<p>I didn’t write much Ruby code with my first site, but I stayed within Ruby’s ecosystem.
I used <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/">Middleman</a> to be close to the experience of Rails, which was popular at the time.
I’ve since returned to Ruby with a different perspective, one that led me to build my own static site generator.
Ruby is no longer trendy and my static site generator has a userbase of one, but I’m more confident that I’ll be able to keep this going several years from now.
<strong>No more rewrites.</strong></p>

<h2 id="personal-touch-">Personal Touch ✍</h2>

<p>In rebuilding this site, I’ve also renewed my commitment to write on my personal, technical blog.</p>

<p>Eight years ago I had the intuition that it would be important to write.
I didn’t know what to write about and I didn’t know why I needed to write, though, so I didn’t follow through.</p>

<p>Now I understand that writing is a super power, even for people that work in software and live in code.
At every software job where I’ve worked, the majority of the challenges are a result of inadequate communication between people.
Being a good communicator doesn’t necessarily make you a good software engineer,
    but it’s harder to be a good software engineer if you’re not a good communicator.
The logic is simple:</p>

<p>➡ Better writing
<br />
➡ Better communication
<br />
➡ Better software</p>

<p>Here’s to trying to write a less cringe-y blog 🥂</p>

    </main>

    
    <script type="module">class BlogPost {
  static REGEXP =
    /(?<text>\P{Extended_Pictographic}+)(?<emoji>\p{Extended_Pictographic}+)?/u;

  static setup() {
    for (const $heading of this.$headings) {
      if (!$heading.id || $heading.childElementCount > 0) {
        continue;
      }

      const match = this.REGEXP.exec($heading.textContent);

      const $fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
      const $anchor = document.createElement("a");

      $anchor.href = `#${$heading.id}`;
      $anchor.textContent = match.groups.text.trim();

      $fragment.append($anchor);
      if (match.groups.emoji) {
        const $span = document.createElement("span");
        $span.textContent = match.groups.emoji;
        $fragment.append($span);
      }

      $heading.textContent = null;
      $heading.append($fragment);
    }
  }

  static get $headings() {
    return this.$page.querySelectorAll("h2, h3, h4, h5, h6");
  }

  static get $page() {
    return document.querySelector(`[data-page^="Blog::"]`);
  }
}

window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => BlogPost.setup());
