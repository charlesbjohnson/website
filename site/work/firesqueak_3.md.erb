I built an ETL pipeline for the finance team of a popular, eco-friendly footwear brand.
The client operated several Shopify sites but needed to collect transaction and payment data into SAP as a single source of truth for accounting.
They had a single in-house engineer and a business stakeholder that I partnered with, but otherwise I worked independently yet transparently.

In the first week I was able to create a technical spec from loose business requirements and by the following week I had a functioning V1.
I was able to deliver well ahead-of-time with no production issues.
The client saved tens of thousands of dollars that they would have otherwise needed to pay to SAP consultants.
