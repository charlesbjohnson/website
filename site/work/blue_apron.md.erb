Blue Apron is a meal-kit delivery company.
The engineering organization had fewer than 100 employees when I joined as a Backend Engineer on the _Consumer_ team.
I joined the _Delight_ squad but the team was later rolled into the _Engagement_ squad.
Delight's priorities were a subset of Engagement's; the former focused on customer retention while the latter prioritized it alongside monetization.

One of the biggest challenges at Blue Apron was in maintaining the written-from-scratch e-commerce engine.
The custom-built nature of the engine allowed the storefront to be deeply integrated with fulfillment on the backend,
    but it came at a steep cost of quality-of-life features and tech debt.
With this in mind, I took ownership over _Address Management_ since it had been historically overlooked and de-prioritized.
I worked on:

- Leading the implementation of _Temporary Address Change_ for deliveries.
- Fixing design issues and bugs that had been the cause of frequent meal-kit mis-deliveries.
- Coordinating with the WMS team on the backend to setup address verification before shipping label generation.

Temporary Address Change was a conceptually simple feature, it allowed customers to change the delivery address of a single order without having to change their subscription.
I implemented the backend of the feature and I was also the tech lead for the Web, iOS, and Android frontend implementations.

Aside from Address Management, I acted as a technical leader by:

- Refactoring trickier parts of the codebase that were not well-understood.
- Actively reviewing code to unblock my peers, regardless of their team.
- Documenting older parts of the codebase that were not well-known.
- Mentoring junior engineers.

My experience at Blue Apron was chaotic since I joined in-between rounds of layoffs.
I shifted between several projects that started and stopped as the company's priorities changed,
    so I did not have the opportunity to complete some of the projects that I worked on.
