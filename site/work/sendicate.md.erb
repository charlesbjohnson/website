Sendicate was a startup with a team consisting of just the two co-founders and myself.
The company's main product was a competitor to Mailchimp, but I joined to work on a new product called _Sellout_.
Sellout was an automated email marketing app for Shopify and Bigcommerce stores.

The headline feature I delivered was _Manual Emails_.
I built a WYSIWYG editor that could design emails using a set of predefined content blocks; essentially a CMS for email campaigns.

The CTO built the backend but gave me free reign to build the frontend since I had more recent experience with JavaScript.
With this project, I:

- Selected a minimal, conceptually simple set of dependencies.
- Made my first contribution to the OSS community via an improvement to one of the Bootstrap framework's interactive components.

This was my first large JavaScript project, but I was able to ship and the feature launch was a success.

Afterwards, I paired with the CTO to add subscription billing and I learned about the backend.
The CTO later left for another company, but I continued to work on Sellout for a period of time.
During that time, I:

- Added caching to the product recommendations engine to improve response times.
- Migrated the infrastructure to another platform to cut costs.
- Fixed bugs and fielded technical customer support.

I didn't ship any new features,
    but I learned a great deal about operating a SAAS product while I was on my own.
