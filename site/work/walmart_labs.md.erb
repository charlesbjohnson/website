@WalmartLabs was the largest organization that I have worked for.
I joined the _SEO_ team as a frontend engineer, but what I actually did was full-stack web development.
The majority of my teammates were data engineers, so I learned that _frontend_ was a relative term.

The SEO team had several responsibilities, but most of the work centered around support for the _Topic Page_ platform.
Topic Pages were a large set of product listing pages on walmart.com that were automatically generated based on data about frequently searched keywords.

Topic Pages were too narrow and too great in number to fit into the site's category-based navigation, but they ranked highly in organic search engine results.
They drove hundreds of thousands of visits in traffic and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue to walmart.com every day.

The Topic Page platform consisted of dozens of services, so every member of the team acted as a custodian of at least one service.
One of the services I maintained was an internal application known as _Mason_, a CMS-like tool for Topic Pages.

Mason was on maintenance mode when I first started working on it.
The app was buggy, hard to use, and almost no one understood its purpose or its capabilities.
The SEO team mainly used it as a manual override for when there were issues with the generation of certain Topic Pages.

When the SEO team started to port the Topic Page platform to support samsclub.com it became clear that Mason needed significant rework.
As part of the porting effort, I:

- Cleared the backlog of reported and unreported bugs.
- Simplified the UI/UX to improve usability.
- Handled support requests from users.
- Created user documentation to reduce the rate of support requests.
- Demoed features to the Site Merchandising team to grow usage.
- Migrated from _pet_ servers to automated, internal cloud hosting.

I was able to make Mason multi-tenant to support Sam's Club while simultaneously increasing usage among the Site Merchandising team on the Walmart side.
Mason became a go-to tool for setting up campaigns in partnership with large brands; a new use case and source of revenue that became possible as a direct result of my efforts.

Aside from Mason, I was also contributor to the customer-facing frontend of Topic Pages on walmart.com and the backing web services.
