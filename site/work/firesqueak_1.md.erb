I built the V1 of an e-commerce product for Firesqueak with one other engineer.
Inspired by the shops that sold out of remote work equipment at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,
    we decided to build a product that would provide stores with in-stock notification behavior.
We started with support for Shopify stores first, but we designed it to work with any e-commerce platform.

I researched, designed, and developed the app. The core features were:

- Support for SMS in-stock notifications.
- An optional code snippet to add an in-stock notification UI to a PDP.
- A REST API backend that the in-stock notification UI integrated with.
- A SPA dashboard for the merchant admin experience, which included:
    - Templating to customize the notification messaging.
    - Previewing to trial the app and to verify template customizations.
    - Reporting to highlight the most sought after products.
    - Charting to display the number of messages sent per day.
    - JWT authentication to embed the UI within Shopify's admin dashboard.
- OAuth authorization to support Shopify's app installation flow.

I also handled the operational work by setting up hosting, provisioning, CI/CD, and monitoring.
The product was a V1, but the technical foundation was mature.
