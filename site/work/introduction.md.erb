Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a software engineer with nearly 10 years of experience.

I build things for the web often in the e-commerce space, but I care about making _good software_ and _making software_ good.
I'm looking for a team that shares these values.

Please [visit my website](https://<%= ::Site.domain %>) to learn more about me and consider [sending me an email](mailto:<%= ::Site.email %>).
